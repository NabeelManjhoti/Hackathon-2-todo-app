# Specification Quality Checklist: Backend API Development

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec focuses on WHAT developers need (endpoints, data persistence, validation) without specifying HOW to implement. Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements have clear acceptance criteria. Made informed assumptions (documented in Assumptions section) rather than leaving clarifications. Edge cases cover common failure scenarios. Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three user stories (P1: Create/Retrieve, P2: Update/Delete, P3: Toggle Completion) cover all CRUD operations. Each story is independently testable. Success criteria focus on developer experience and system behavior, not implementation.

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated successfully

**Summary**:
- Content Quality: 4/4 items passed
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 items passed
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 items passed

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase. No clarifications or updates needed.

## Notes

- Spec successfully avoids implementation details while providing clear requirements
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults (UUID format, ISO 8601 timestamps, etc.)
- Out of Scope section clearly defers authentication to future spec (Spec 3)
- All three user stories are independently testable and prioritized appropriately
